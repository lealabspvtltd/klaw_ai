Nikola Tesla
Nikola Tesla (/ˈnɪkələ ˈtɛslə/;[1] Serbian Cyrillic:
Никола Тесла [nǐkola têsla]; 10 July 1856 – 7 January
1943) was a Serbian-American[2][3] engineer, futurist,
and inventor. He is known for his contributions to the
design of the modern alternating current (AC)
electricity supply system.[4]
Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first
studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without
receiving a degree. He then gained practical experience
in the early 1880s working in telephony and at
Continental Edison in the new electric power industry.
In 1884 he immigrated to the United States, where he
became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short
time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City
before he struck out on his own. With the help of
partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up
laboratories and companies in New York to develop a
range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC
induction motor and related polyphase AC patents,
licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him
a considerable amount of money and became the
cornerstone of the polyphase system which that
company eventually marketed.
Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and
market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with
mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge
tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a
wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever
exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and
demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and
wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his
showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s,
Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and
worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his
high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in
New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made
pronouncements on the possibility of wireless
communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put

Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental
wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran
out of funding before he could complete it.
After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series
of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying
degrees of success. Having spent most of his money,
Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving
behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in
January 1943.[5] Tesla's work fell into relative
obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the
General Conference on Weights and Measures named
the International System of Units (SI) measurement of
magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has
been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the
1990s.[6]

Early years
Nikola Tesla was born into an ethnic Serb family in the village of
Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire
(present-day Croatia), on 10 July 1856.[8][9] His father, Milutin
Tesla (1819–1879),[10] was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox
Church.[11][12][13][14] His father's brother Josif was a lecturer at a
military academy who wrote several textbooks on
mathematics.[10]
Tesla's rebuilt birth house (parish
hall) and the church where his father
served in Smiljan, Croatia. The site
was made into a museum to honor
him.[7]

Tesla's mother, Georgina "Đuka" Mandić (1822–1892), whose
father was also an Eastern Orthodox priest,[15] had a talent for
making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability
to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a
formal education. Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative
abilities to his mother's genetics and influence.[16][17]

Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina, and Marica, and an older
brother named Dane, who was killed in a horse-riding accident when Tesla was aged six or seven.[18] In
1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In
1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby town of Gospić, where Tesla's father worked as parish priest.
Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school. In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac[19] to
attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual
throughout schools within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.[20][21] Later in his patent applications,
before he obtained American citizenship, Tesla would identify himself as "of Smiljan, Lika, border
country of Austria-Hungary".[22]

Tesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by
his physics professor.[a] Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this
"mysterious phenomena" made him want "to know more of this wonderful
force".[25] Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which
prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating.[26] He finished a fouryear term in three years, graduating in 1873.[27]

Tesla's father, Milutin,
was an Orthodox priest
in the village of Smiljan.

After graduating Tesla returned to Smiljan but soon contracted cholera, was
bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times. In a moment of
despair, Tesla's father (who had originally wanted him to enter the
priesthood),[28] promised to send him to the best engineering school if he
recovered from the illness.[29] Tesla later said that he had read Mark Twain's
earlier works while recovering from his illness.[30][31]

The next year Tesla evaded conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army in
Smiljan[32] by running away southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near Gračac.
There he explored the mountains wearing hunter's garb. Tesla said that this contact with nature made him
stronger, both physically and mentally. He enrolled at the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz in
1875 on a Military Frontier scholarship. Tesla passed nine exams (nearly twice as many as required[33])
and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated,
"Your son is a star of first rank."[33] At Graz, Tesla noted his fascination with the detailed lectures on
electricity presented by Professor Jakob Pöschl and described how he made suggestions on improving the
design of an electric motor the professor was demonstrating.[30][34] But by his third year he was failing in
school and never graduated, leaving Graz in December 1878. One biographer suggests Tesla was not
studying and may have been expelled for gambling and womanizing.[35]
Tesla's family did not hear from him after he left school.[36] There was a
rumor among his classmates that he had drowned in the nearby river Mur
but in January one of them ran into Tesla in the town of Maribor and
reported that encounter to Tesla's family.[37] It turned out Tesla had been
working there as a draftsman for 60 florins per month.[35] In March 1879,
Milutin finally located his son and tried to convince him to return home
and take up his education in Prague.[37] Tesla returned to Gospić later that
month when he was deported for not having a residence permit.[37] Tesla's
father died the next month, on 17 April 1879, at the age of 60 after an
unspecified illness.[37] During the rest of the year Tesla taught a large
class of students in his old school in Gospić.
Tesla aged 23, c. 1879

In January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put together enough money to help
him leave Gospić for Prague, where he was to study. He arrived too late to
enroll at Charles-Ferdinand University; he had never studied Greek, a required subject; and he was
illiterate in Czech, another required subject. Tesla did, however, attend lectures in philosophy at the
university as an auditor but he did not receive grades for the courses.[38][39]

Working at Budapest Telephone Exchange
Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, in 1881 to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the
Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction,
was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few
months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief
electrician position. During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station
equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor
publicly described.[30]

Working at Edison
In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company.[40] Tesla
began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in
large scale electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société
Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting
system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took
notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building
improved versions of generating dynamos and motors.[41] They also sent him on to troubleshoot
engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.

Moving to the United States
In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been
overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the United
States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing
division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be
brought to the United States as well.[43] In June 1884, Tesla
emigrated[44] and began working almost immediately at the
Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded
shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers,
managing staff, and 20 "field engineers" struggling with the task
of building the large electric utility in that city.[45] As in Paris,
Edison Machine Works on Goerck
Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving
Street, New York. Tesla found the
generators.[46] Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have
change from cosmopolitan Europe
to working at this shop, located
met company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times.[45]

One of those times was noted in Tesla's autobiography where, after

liner SS Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a
quip about their "Parisian" being out all night. After Tesla told
them he had been up all night fixing the Oregon, Edison commented to Batchelor that "this is a damned
good man".[42] One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp–based street lighting
system.[47][48] Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and
was incompatible with the Edison low-voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose

contracts in some cities. Tesla's designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical
improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison made with an
arc lighting company.[49]
Tesla had been working at the Machine Works for a total of six months when he quit.[45] What event
precipitated his leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for
redesigning generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved.[47] Tesla had previous run-ins with
the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned.[50][51] In his autobiography, Tesla
stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design "twenty-four
different types of standard machines" "but it turned out to be a practical joke".[52] Later versions of this
story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal, quipping: "Tesla, you don't
understand our American humor".[53][54] The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd,
since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay,[b] and the company did not have that
amount of cash (equal to $1,749,815 today) on hand.[56][57] Tesla's diary contains just one comment on
what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering 7
December 1884, to 4 January 1885, saying "Good By to the Edison Machine Works".[48][58]

Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing
Soon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system,[59]
possibly the same one he had developed at Edison.[45] In March 1885, he met with patent attorney
Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents.[59]
Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an
arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light and
Manufacturing Company.[60] Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an
improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system
in Rahway, New Jersey.[61] Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on
its advanced features.
The investors showed little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of alternating current motors and
electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the
manufacturing side of the business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility.[62]
They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla's company and leaving the inventor penniless.[62]
Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in
exchange for stock.[62] He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per
day. Later in life, Tesla recounted that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing "My high education in
various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery".[62][c]

AC and the induction motor
In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles
Fletcher Peck.[64] The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and
patents for financial gain.[65] Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermomagnetic motor idea,[66] they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together
they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated

patents would go 1⁄3 to Tesla, 1⁄3 to Peck and Brown, and 1⁄3 to fund
development.[65] They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in
Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of
electric motors, generators, and other devices.
In 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating
current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding in
Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance,
high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which
generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla
claimed to have conceived in 1882).[67][68][69] This innovative electric
motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did
not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance
of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.[70][71]
Along with getting the motor patented, Peck and Brown arranged to get
the motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a
functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical
Drawing from U.S. patent
publications for articles to run concurrently with the issue of the

patent.[72] Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and
gle.com/patent/US381968),
Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged
illustrating the principle of
for Tesla to demonstrate his AC motor on 16 May 1888 at the American
Tesla's alternating current
Institute of Electrical Engineers.[72][73] Engineers working for the
induction motor
Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George
Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system
—something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing.
Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based
induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo
Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.[74][75]
In July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's
polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50
per AC horsepower produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee
of $2,000 ($70,000 in today's dollars[76]) per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric &
Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.[77]
During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the
city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse
engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC system
that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found that it would
not work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up
using a DC traction motor instead.[78][79]

Market turmoil
Tesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both
in 1888, came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies.[80][81] The three big firms,
Westinghouse, Edison, and Thomson-Houston Electric Company, were trying to grow in a capital-

intensive business while financially undercutting each other. There was
even a "war of currents" propaganda campaign going on, with Edison
Electric claiming their direct current system was better and safer than the
Westinghouse alternating current system and Thomson-Houston
sometimes siding with Edison.[82][83] Competing in this market meant
Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to
develop Tesla's motor and the related polyphase system right away.[84]
Two years after signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in
trouble. The near collapse of Barings Bank in London triggered the
financial panic of 1890, causing investors to call in their loans to
Westinghouse Electric.[85] The sudden cash shortage forced the company
to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut
back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other
Tesla's AC dynamo-electric
companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the
machine (AC electric
[86][87]
generator) in an 1888 U.S.
Tesla contract.
At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been

unsuccessful and was stuck in development.
Westinghouse was

paying a $15,000-a-year guaranteed royalty[88] even though operating

examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to
run it were even rarer.[70][85] In early 1891, George Westinghouse
explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, if he did not meet the demands of
his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to "deal with
the bankers" to try to collect future royalties.[89] The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to
champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the
royalty payment clause in the contract.[89][90] Six years later Westinghouse purchased Tesla's patent for a
lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent-sharing agreement signed with General Electric (a
company created from the 1892 merger of Edison and Thomson-Houston).[91][92][93]

New York laboratories
The money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him
independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to pursue
his own interests.[94] In 1889, Tesla moved out of the Liberty
Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for the next dozen
years worked out of a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in
Manhattan. These included a lab at 175 Grand Street (1889–1892),
the fourth floor of 33–35 South Fifth Avenue (1892–1895), and
sixth and seventh floors of 46 & 48 East Houston Street (1895–
1902).[95][96] Tesla and his hired staff conducted some of his most
significant work in these workshops.

Avenue laboratory, 1894

Tesla coil
In the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich
Hertz's 1886–1888 experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio
waves.[97] In repeating and then expanding on these experiments Tesla tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil

with a high speed alternator he had been developing as part of an improved arc lighting system but found
that the high-frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary
and secondary windings in the coil. To fix this problem Tesla came up with his "oscillating transformer",
with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron
core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil.[98] Later called the Tesla coil, it
would be used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity.[99] He
would use this resonant transformer circuit in his later wireless power work.[100][101]

Citizenship
On 30 July 1891, aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States.[102][103] In the same
year, he patented his Tesla coil.[104]

Wireless lighting
After 1890, Tesla experimented with transmitting power by
inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages
generated with his Tesla coil.[105] He attempted to develop a
wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and
capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public
demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent
light bulbs from across a stage.[106] He spent most of the decade
working on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of
various investors but none of the ventures succeeded in making a
commercial product out of his findings.[107]

College via two long Geissler tubes
(similar to neon tubes) in his hands

In 1893 at St. Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the National Electric Light
Association, Tesla told onlookers that he was sure a system like
his could eventually conduct "intelligible signals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use
of wires" by conducting it through the Earth.[108][109]
Tesla served as a vice-president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1892 to 1894, the
forerunner of the modern-day IEEE (along with the Institute of Radio Engineers).[110]

Polyphase system and the Columbian Exposition
By the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott and then Benjamin G. Lamme had
made progress on an efficient version of Tesla's induction motor. Lamme found a way to make the
polyphase system it would need compatible with older single-phase AC and DC systems by developing a
rotary converter.[111] Westinghouse Electric now had a way to provide electricity to all potential
customers and started branding their polyphase AC system as the "Tesla Polyphase System". They
believed that Tesla's patents gave them patent priority over other polyphase AC systems.[112]
Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to participate in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago
where the company had a large space in the "Electricity Building" devoted to electrical exhibits.
Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with alternating current and it was a key event

in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the
American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of an
alternating current system that was polyphase and could also
supply the other AC and DC exhibits at the fair.[113][114][115]
A special exhibit space was set up to display various forms and
models of Tesla's induction motor. The rotating magnetic field that
drove them was explained through a series of demonstrations
including an Egg of Columbus that used the two-phase coil found
in an induction motor to spin a copper egg making it stand on
end.[116]

"Tesla Polyphase System" at
Chicago's 1893 Columbian
Exposition

Tesla visited the fair for a week during its six-month run to attend
the International Electrical Congress and put on a series of
demonstrations at the Westinghouse exhibit.[117][118] A specially
darkened room had been set up where Tesla showed his wireless
lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe;[119]
these included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light wireless gas-discharge
lamps.[120]
An observer noted:
Within the room were suspended two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil. These were about
fifteen feet apart and served as terminals of the wires leading from the transformers. When the
current was turned on, the lamps or tubes, which had no wires connected to them, but lay on a
table between the suspended plates, or which might be held in the hand in almost any part of
the room, were made luminous. These were the same experiments and the same apparatus
shown by Tesla in London about two years previous, "where they produced so much wonder
and astonishment".[121]

Steam-powered oscillating generator
During his presentation at the International Electrical Congress in the Columbian Exposition Agriculture
Hall, Tesla introduced his steam-powered reciprocating electricity generator that he patented that year,
something he thought was a better way to generate alternating current.[122] Steam was forced into the
oscillator and rushed out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an
armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic
field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the
complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to
generate electricity.[123][124]

Consulting on Niagara
In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought
Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls. Over several years,
there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to do it. Among the systems
proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC,

and compressed air. Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing
systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a
Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company
awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the
Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition. At
the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution
system.[125]

The Nikola Tesla Company
In 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help
found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents
and inventions as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under
Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney.[126] It
found few investors, since the mid-1890s were a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and
oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company handled Tesla's patents for
decades to come.

Lab fire
In the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab
caught fire. It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th-floor lab burned and
collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, but it also destroyed a
collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that
had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told The New York Times "I am in too
much grief to talk. What can I say?".[127] After the fire Tesla moved to 46 & 48 East Houston Street and
rebuilt his lab on the 6th and 7th floors.

X-ray experimentation
Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as
radiant energy of "invisible" kinds after he had noticed damaged
film in his laboratory in previous experiments[128] (later identified
as "Roentgen rays" or "X-rays"). His early experiments were with
Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Tesla may
have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few
weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen's December 1895 announcement of the
discovery of X-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark Twain
illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge
tube. The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking
screw on the camera lens.[129]
In March 1896, after hearing of Röntgen's discovery of X-ray and
X-ray imaging (radiography),[130] Tesla proceeded to do his own
X-ray Tesla took of his hand
experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high-energy singleterminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target
electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla coil (the modern term for the phenomenon

produced by this device is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation). In his research, Tesla devised several
experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the "instrument will ... enable
one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus".[131]
Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many
notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He
believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone
generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that
X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can
occur in force-free magnetic fields.[132][133]
On 11 July 1934, the New York Herald Tribune published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an
event that occasionally took place while experimenting with his single-electrode vacuum tubes. A minute
particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike him:[134]
Tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place
where it passed out. In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his
"electric gun", Tesla said, "The particles in the beam of force ... will travel much faster than
such particles ... and they will travel in concentrations".

Radio remote control
In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control
—which he dubbed "telautomaton"—to the public during an electrical
exhibition at Madison Square Garden.[136] Tesla tried to sell his idea to the
US military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little
interest.[137] Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I
and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military
programs.[138] Tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate
"Teleautomatics" in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in
Chicago, while he was traveling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.

Wireless power
From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a great deal of his time and
fortune on a series of projects trying to develop the transmission of
electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using
coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless
lighting. He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power
around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a
way to transmit worldwide communications.

In 1898, Tesla
demonstrated a radiocontrolled boat, which he
hoped to sell as a guided
torpedo to navies around
the world.[135]

At the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit
communication signals over long distances, let alone large amounts of power. Tesla had studied radio
waves early on, and came to the conclusion that part of the existing study on them, by Hertz, was
incorrect.[139][140][d] Also, this new form of radiation was widely considered at the time to be a short-

distance phenomenon that seemed to die out in less than a mile.[142] Tesla
noted that, even if theories on radio waves were true, they were totally
worthless for his intended purposes, since this form of "invisible light"
would diminish over a distance just like any other radiation and would
travel in straight lines right out into space, becoming "hopelessly
lost".[143]

wireless power experiments
at his East Houston St.
laboratory

By the mid-1890s, Tesla was working on the idea that he might be able to
conduct electricity long distance through the Earth or the atmosphere, and
began working on experiments to test this idea including setting up a large
resonance transformer magnifying transmitter in his East Houston Street
lab.[144][145][146] Seeming to borrow from a common idea at the time that
the Earth's atmosphere was conductive,[147][148] he proposed a system
composed of balloons suspending, transmitting, and receiving, electrodes
in the air above 30,000 feet (9,100 m) in altitude, where he thought the
lower pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions of volts)
long distances.

Colorado Springs
To further study the conductive nature of low-pressure air, Tesla set up an
experimental station at high altitude in Colorado Springs during
1899.[149][150][151][152] There he could safely operate much larger coils
than in the cramped confines of his New York lab, and an associate had
made an arrangement for the El Paso Electric Light Company to supply
alternating current free of charge.[152] To fund his experiments, he
convinced John Jacob Astor IV to invest $100,000 ($3,779,600 in today's
dollars[76]) to become a majority shareholder in the Nikola Tesla
Company. Astor thought he was primarily investing in the new wireless
lighting system. Instead, Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado
Springs experiments.[153] Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he
planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals
from Pikes Peak to Paris.[154]

Tesla's Colorado Springs
laboratory

There, he conducted experiments with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, producing artificial
lightning (and thunder) consisting of millions of volts and discharges of up to 135 feet (41 m) in
length,[156] and, at one point, inadvertently burned out the generator in El Paso, causing a power
outage.[157] The observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes led him to (incorrectly)
conclude[158][159] that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy.
During his time at his laboratory, Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to
be communications from another planet. He mentioned them in a letter to a reporter in December
1899[160] and to the Red Cross Society in December 1900.[161][162] Reporters treated it as a sensational
story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars.[161] He expanded on the signals
he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier's Weekly article entitled "Talking With Planets", where he said it
had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing "intelligently controlled signals" and that
the signals could have come from Mars, Venus, or other planets.[162] It has been hypothesized that he may

have intercepted Guglielmo Marconi's European experiments in
July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S
(dot/dot/dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses
that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado[162]—or signals from
another experimenter in wireless transmission.[163]

transmitter" generating millions of

operation, but only produced for
effect by rapidly cycling the power
switch.[155]

Tesla had an agreement with the editor of The Century Magazine
to produce an article on his findings. The magazine sent a
photographer to Colorado to photograph the work being done
there. The article, titled "The Problem of Increasing Human
Energy", appeared in the June 1900 edition of the magazine. He
explained the superiority of the wireless system he envisioned but
the article was more of a lengthy philosophical treatise than an
understandable scientific description of his work,[164] illustrated
with what were to become iconic images of Tesla and his
Colorado Springs experiments.

Wardenclyffe
Tesla made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for what he
thought would be a viable system of wireless transmission, wining and
dining them at the Waldorf-Astoria's Palm Garden (the hotel where he was
living at the time), The Players Club, and Delmonico's.[165] In March
1901, he obtained $150,000 ($5,669,400 in today's dollars[76]) from J. P.
Morgan in return for a 51% share of any generated wireless patents, and
began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility to be built in Shoreham,
New York, 100 miles (161 km) east of the city on the North Shore of Long
Island.[166]
Tesla's Wardenclyffe plant

By July 1901, Tesla had expanded his plans to build a more powerful
on Long Island in 1904.
From this facility, Tesla
transmitter to leap ahead of Marconi's radio-based system, which Tesla
[161]
hoped to demonstrate
thought was a copy of his own.
He approached Morgan to ask for
wireless transmission of
more money to build the larger system, but Morgan refused to supply any
electrical energy across the
further funds.[163] In December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted
Atlantic.
the letter S from England to Newfoundland, defeating Tesla in the race to
be first to complete such a transmission. A month after Marconi's success,
Tesla tried to get Morgan to back an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling
"vibrations throughout the globe".[161] Over the next five years, Tesla wrote more than 50 letters to
Morgan, pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe.
Tesla continued the project for another nine months into 1902. The tower was erected to its full height of
187 feet (57 m).[163] In June 1902, Tesla moved his lab operations from Houston Street to
Wardenclyffe.[166]
Investors on Wall Street were putting their money into Marconi's system, and some in the press began
turning against Tesla's project, claiming it was a hoax.[167] The project came to a halt in 1905, and in
1906, the financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer
suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla's part.[168] Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to

cover his debts at the Waldorf-Astoria, which eventually amounted to $20,000 ($627,800 in today's
dollars[76]).[169] He lost the property in foreclosure in 1915, and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by
the new owner to make the land a more viable real estate asset.

Later years
After Wardenclyffe closed, Tesla continued to write to Morgan; after "the great man" died, Tesla wrote to
Morgan's son Jack, trying to get further funding for the project. In 1906, Tesla opened offices at 165
Broadway in Manhattan, trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing his patents. He went
on to have offices at the Metropolitan Life Tower from 1910 to 1914; rented for a few months at the
Woolworth Building, moving out because he could not afford the rent; and then to office space at 8 West
40th Street from 1915 to 1925. After moving to 8 West 40th Street, he was effectively bankrupt. Most of
his patents had run out and he was having trouble with the new inventions he was trying to develop.[170]

Bladeless turbine
On his 50th birthday, in 1906, Tesla demonstrated a 200
horsepower (150 kilowatts) 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine. During
1910–1911, at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several
of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000 hp.[171]
Tesla worked with several companies including from 1919 to 1922
in Milwaukee, for Allis-Chalmers.[172][173] He spent most of his
time trying to perfect the Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the
head engineer at the company, but engineering difficulties meant it
was never made into a practical device.[174] Tesla did license the
idea to a precision instrument company and it found use in the
form of luxury car speedometers and other instruments.[175]

Wireless lawsuits
When World War I broke out, the British cut the transatlantic telegraph cable linking the US to Germany
in order to control the flow of information between the two countries. They also tried to shut off German
wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio
company Telefunken for patent infringement.[176] Telefunken brought in the physicists Jonathan Zenneck
and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense, and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a
month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in
1917.[176][177]
In 1915, Tesla attempted to sue the Marconi Company for infringement of his wireless tuning patents.
Marconi's initial radio patent had been awarded in the US in 1897, but his 1900 patent submission
covering improvements to radio transmission had been rejected several times, before it was finally
approved in 1904, on the grounds that it infringed on other existing patents including two 1897 Tesla
wireless power tuning patents.[140][178][179] Tesla's 1915 case went nowhere,[180] but in a related case,
where the Marconi Company tried to sue the US government over WWI patent infringements, a Supreme
Court of the United States 1943 decision restored the prior patents of Oliver Lodge, John Stone, and

Tesla.[181] The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve
radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patented improvements were questionable,
the company could not claim infringement on those same patents.[140][182]

Nobel Prize rumors
On 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics
awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm
stated the prize that year was being awarded to William Henry Bragg and Lawrence Bragg "for their
services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays".[183][184][185] There were unsubstantiated
rumors at the time that either Tesla or Edison had refused the prize.[183] The Nobel Foundation said, "Any
rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse
the reward is ridiculous"; a recipient could decline a Nobel Prize only after he is announced a winner.[183]
There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original
recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each
sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept
the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a
wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.[17][183]
In the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won a Nobel prize (although Edison received one
of 38 possible bids in 1915 and Tesla received one of 38 possible bids in 1937).[186]

Other awards, patents and ideas
Tesla won numerous medals and awards over this time. They include:
Grand Officer of the Order of St. Sava (Serbia, 1892)
Elliott Cresson Medal (Franklin Institute, US, 1894)[187]
Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Danilo I (Montenegro, 1895)[188]
Member of the American Philosophical Society (US, 1896)[189]
AIEE Edison Medal (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, US, 1916)[190]
Grand Cross of the Order of St. Sava (Yugoslavia, 1926)[191]
Cross of the Order of the Yugoslav Crown (Yugoslavia, 1931)
John Scott Medal (Franklin Institute & Philadelphia City Council, US, 1934)[187]
Order of the White Eagle (Yugoslavia, 1936)
Grand Cross of the Order of the White Lion (Czechoslovakia, 1937)[192]
Medal of the University of Paris (Paris, France, 1937)
The Medal of the University St. Clement of Ochrida (Sofia, Bulgaria, 1939)
Tesla attempted to market several devices based on the production of ozone. These included his 1900
Tesla Ozone Company selling an 1896 patented device based on his Tesla coil, used to bubble ozone
through different types of oils to make a therapeutic gel.[193] He also tried to develop a variation of this a
few years later as a room sanitizer for hospitals.[194]

Tesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain
enhanced intelligence. In 1912, he crafted "a plan to make dull
students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity,"
wiring the walls of a schoolroom and, "saturating [the
schoolroom] with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high
frequency. The whole room will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be
converted into a health-giving and stimulating electromagnetic
field or 'bath.' "[195] The plan was, at least provisionally, approved
by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H.
Maxwell.[195]

Before World War I, Tesla sought overseas investors. After the war
started, Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in
European countries.
In the August 1917 edition of the magazine Electrical Experimenter, Tesla postulated that electricity
could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an "electric ray" of "tremendous
frequency," with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a
superficial resemblance to modern radar).[196] Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high-frequency
radio waves would penetrate water.[197] Émile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first radar system
in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla's general speculation that a very strong high-frequency signal
would be needed was correct. Girardeau said, "(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his
disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was
dreaming correctly".[198]
In 1928, Tesla received patent, U.S. patent 1,655,114 (https://patents.google.com/patent/US1655114), for
a biplane design capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), which "gradually tilted through
manipulation of the elevator devices" in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane.[199] This
impractical design was something Tesla thought would sell for less than $1,000.[200][201]
Tesla had a further office at 350 Madison Ave[202] but by 1928 he no longer had a laboratory or
funding.[201]

Living circumstances
Tesla lived at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City from 1900 and ran up a large bill.[203] He moved to
the St. Regis Hotel in 1922 and followed a pattern from then on of moving to a different hotel every few
years and leaving unpaid bills behind.[204][205]
Tesla walked to the park every day to feed the pigeons. He began feeding them at the window of his hotel
room and nursed injured birds back to health.[205][206][207] He said that he had been visited by a certain
injured white pigeon daily. He spent over $2,000 (equivalent to $37,570 in 2024) to care for the bird,
including a device he built to support her comfortably while her broken wing and leg healed.[208] Tesla
stated:
I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years. But there was one, a beautiful bird,
pure white with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different. It was a female. I had only
to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. I loved that pigeon as a man loves a

woman, and she loved me. As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life.[209]
Tesla's unpaid bills, as well as complaints about the mess made by pigeons, led to his eviction from St.
Regis in 1923. He was also forced to leave the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1930 and the Hotel Governor
Clinton in 1934.[205] At one point he also took rooms at the Hotel Marguery.[210]
Tesla moved to the Hotel New Yorker in 1934. At this time Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing
Company began paying him $125 (equivalent to $2,940 in 2024) per month in addition to paying his rent.
Accounts of how this came about vary. Several sources claim that Westinghouse was concerned, or
possibly warned, about potential bad publicity arising from the impoverished conditions in which their
former star inventor was living.[211][212][213][214] The payment has been described as being couched as a
"consulting fee" to get around Tesla's aversion to accepting charity. Tesla biographer Marc Seifer
described the Westinghouse payments as a type of "unspecified settlement".[213]

Birthday press conferences
In 1931, a young journalist whom Tesla befriended, Kenneth M.
Swezey, organized a celebration for the inventor's 75th
birthday.[215] Tesla received congratulations from figures in
science and engineering such as Albert Einstein,[216] and he was
also featured on the cover of Time magazine.[217] The cover
caption "All the world's his power house" noted his contribution to
electrical power generation. The party went so well that Tesla
made it an annual event, an occasion where he would put out a
large spread of food and drink—featuring dishes of his own
creation. He invited the press in order to see his inventions and
hear stories about his past exploits, views on current events, and
sometimes baffling claims.[218][219]
At the 1932 party, Tesla claimed he had invented a motor that
would run on cosmic rays.[219] In 1933, at age 77, Tesla told
reporters at the event that, after 35 years of work, he was on the
verge of producing proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it
was a theory of energy that was "violently opposed" to Einsteinian
physics and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be
cheap to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was
working on a way to transmit individualized private radio
wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and
developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.[220]

Tesla on Time magazine
commemorating his 75th birthday

At the 1934 occasion, Tesla told reporters he had designed a
Newspaper representation of the
[221][222]
thought camera Tesla described at
superweapon he claimed would end all war.
He called it
his 1933 birthday party
"teleforce", but was usually referred to as his death ray.[223] In
1940, the New York Times gave a range for the ray of 250 miles
(400 km), with an expected development cost of US$2 million
(equivalent to $44.89 million in 2024).[224] Tesla described it as a defensive weapon that would be put up
along the border of a country and be used against attacking ground-based infantry or aircraft. Tesla never

revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked during his lifetime but, in 1984, they surfaced at the
Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade.[225] The treatise, The New Art of Projecting Concentrated
Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, described an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet
seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts,
and directing them in streams (through electrostatic repulsion).[219][226] Tesla tried to attract interest of
the US War Department,[227] United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.[228]
In 1935, at his 79th birthday party, Tesla covered many topics. He claimed to have discovered the cosmic
ray in 1896 and invented a way to produce direct current by induction, and made many claims about his
mechanical oscillator.[229] Describing the device (which he expected would earn him $100 million within
two years) he told reporters that a version of his oscillator had caused an earthquake in his 46 East
Houston Street lab and neighboring streets in Lower Manhattan in 1898.[229] He went on to tell reporters
his oscillator could destroy the Empire State Building with 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of air pressure.[230] He also
proposed using his oscillators to transmit vibrations into the ground. He claimed it would work over any
distance and could be used for communication or locating underground mineral deposits, a technique he
called "telegeodynamics".[134]
In 1937, at his Grand Ballroom of Hotel New Yorker event, Tesla received the Order of the White Lion
from the Czechoslovak ambassador and a medal from the Yugoslav ambassador. On questions concerning
the death ray, Tesla stated: "But it is not an experiment ... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a
little time will pass before I can give it to the world."[219]

Death
In the fall of 1937 at the age of 81, after midnight one night, Tesla
left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the
cathedral and library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a
couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was struck by a moving
taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely
wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The
full extent of his injuries was never known; Tesla refused to
consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully
recovered.[231][232]

Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker,
where Tesla died

On 7 January 1943, at the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room
3327 of the Hotel New Yorker. His body was found by maid Alice
Monaghan when she entered Tesla's room, ignoring the "do not
disturb" sign that Tesla had placed on his door two days earlier.
Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined the body
and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis (a
type of heart attack).
Two days later the Federal Bureau of Investigation ordered the
Alien Property Custodian to seize Tesla's belongings. John G.
Trump, a professor at M.I.T. and a well-known electrical engineer

Commemorative plaque, New
Yorker Hotel

serving as a technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee, was called in to analyze the
Tesla items. After a three-day investigation, Trump's report concluded that there was nothing which
would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands, stating:
His [Tesla's] thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a
speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character often concerned with the
production and wireless transmission of power; but did not include new, sound, workable
principles or methods for realizing such results.[233]
In a box purported to contain a part of Tesla's "death ray", Trump found a 45-year-old multidecade
resistance box.[234]
On 10 January 1943, New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia read a eulogy written by SloveneAmerican author Louis Adamic live over WNYC radio while violin pieces "Ave Maria" and "Tamo
daleko" were played in the background. On 12 January, two thousand people attended a state funeral for
Tesla at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. After the funeral, Tesla's body was taken to
the Ferncliff Cemetery in Ardsley, New York, where it was later cremated. The following day, a second
service was conducted by prominent priests in the Trinity Chapel (today's Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of
Saint Sava) in New York City.

Personal life and character
Tesla was a lifelong bachelor, who had once explained that his
chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities.[235] In an
interview with the Galveston Daily News on 10 August 1924 he
stated, "Now the soft-voiced gentlewoman of my reverent worship
has all but vanished. In her place has come the woman who thinks
that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as
possible like man—in dress, voice and actions..."[210] Although he
told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not
marrying, he had made too great a sacrifice to his work,[208] Tesla
chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships,
instead finding all the stimulation he needed in his work.
Tesla was asocial and prone to seclude himself with his
work.[136][236][237] However, when he did engage in social life,
many people spoke very positively and admiringly of Tesla.
Tesla c. 1896
Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a
"distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement,
generosity, and force".[238] His secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: "his genial smile and nobility of bearing
always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul".[239] Tesla's friend
Julian Hawthorne wrote, "seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher,
an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink".[240]

Tesla was a good friend of Francis Marion Crawford, Robert Underwood Johnson,[241] Stanford
White,[242] Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, and Kenneth Swezey.[243][244][245] In middle age, Tesla
became a close friend of Mark Twain; they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere.[241]
Twain notably described Tesla's induction motor invention as "the most valuable patent since the
telephone".[246] At a party thrown by actress Sarah Bernhardt in 1896, Tesla met Indian Hindu monk
Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda later wrote that Tesla said he could demonstrate mathematically the
relationship between matter and energy, something Vivekananda hoped would give a scientific foundation
to Vedantic cosmology.[247][248] The meeting with Swami Vivekananda stimulated Tesla's interest in
Eastern Science, which led to Tesla studying Hindu and Vedic philosophy for a number of years.[249]
Tesla later wrote an article titled "Man's Greatest Achievement" using Sanskrit terms akasha and prana to
describe the relationship between matter and energy.[250][251] In the late 1920s, Tesla befriended George
Sylvester Viereck, a poet, writer, mystic, and later a Nazi propagandist. Tesla occasionally attended
dinner parties held by Viereck and his wife.[252][253]
Tesla could be harsh at times and openly expressed disgust for overweight people, such as when he fired
a secretary because of her weight.[254] He was quick to criticize clothing; on several occasions, Tesla
directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress.[235] When Thomas Edison died in 1931, Tesla
contributed the only negative opinion to The New York Times, buried in an extensive coverage of Edison's
life:
He had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the
most elementary rules of hygiene ... His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense
ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I
was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would
have saved him 90 percent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and
mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical
American sense.[255][256]
Tesla became a vegetarian in his later years, living on only milk, bread, honey, and vegetable
juices.[222][257]

Views and beliefs
On experimental and theoretical physics
Tesla disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there
was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge. He believed that if electrons existed at all,
they were some fourth state of matter or "sub-atom" that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and
that they had nothing to do with electricity.[258][259] Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could
not change state or be split in any way. He was a believer in the 19th-century concept of an all-pervasive
ether that transmitted electrical energy.[260]
Tesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy.[261] He was
also critical of Einstein's theory of relativity, saying:

I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason
that it can have no properties. It might as well be said
that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes
and these are of our own making. Of properties we can
only speak when dealing with matter filling the space.
To say that in the presence of large bodies space
becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something
can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to
such a view.[262]
In 1935 he described relativity as "a beggar wrapped in purple
whom ignorant people take for a king" and said his own
experiments had measured the speed of cosmic rays from Arcturus
as fifty times the speed of light.[263]

Tesla c. 1885

Tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle
regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892,[261] and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a
letter to have completed a "dynamic theory of gravity" that "[would] put an end to idle speculations and
false conceptions, as that of curved space". He stated that the theory was "worked out in all details" and
that he hoped to soon give it to the world.[264] Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his
writings.[265]

On society
Tesla is widely considered by his biographers to have been a humanist in philosophical outlook.[266][267]
This did not preclude Tesla, like many of his era, from becoming a proponent of an imposed selective
breeding version of eugenics.
Tesla expressed the belief that human "pity" had come to interfere with the natural "ruthless workings of
nature". Though his argumentation did not depend on a concept of a "master race" or the inherent
superiority of one person over another, he advocated for eugenics. In a 1937 interview he stated:
... man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. The only
method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the
unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct ... The trend of opinion
among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a
desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more
occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual
criminal.[268]
In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women
toward gender equality, and indicated that humanity's future would be run by "Queen Bees". He believed
that women would become the dominant sex in the future.[269]

Tesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post-World War I environment in a printed article
entitled "Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War"
(20 December 1914).[270] Tesla believed that the League of Nations was not a remedy for the times and
issues.[30]

On religion
Tesla was raised an Orthodox Christian. Later in life he did not consider himself to be a "believer in the
orthodox sense", said he opposed religious fanaticism, and said "Buddhism and Christianity are the
greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance."[271] He also said "To me, the universe
is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end" and "what we call 'soul' or
'spirit,' is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. When this functioning ceases, the
'soul' or the 'spirit' ceases likewise."[271]

Literary works
Tesla wrote a number of books and articles for magazines and journals.[272] Among his books are My
Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, compiled and edited by Ben Johnston in 1983 from a
series of 1919 magazine articles by Tesla which were republished in 1977; The Fantastic Inventions of
Nikola Tesla (1993), compiled and edited by David Hatcher Childress; and The Tesla Papers.
Many of Tesla's writings are freely available online,[273] including the article "The Problem of Increasing
Human Energy", published in The Century Magazine in 1900,[274] and the article "Experiments with
Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency", published in his book Inventions, Researches
and Writings of Nikola Tesla.[275][276]

Legacy and honors
In 1952, following pressure from Tesla's nephew, influential
Yugoslav politician Sava Kosanović, Tesla's entire estate was
shipped to Belgrade in 80 trunks marked N.T. In 1957,
Kosanović's secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla's ashes
from the United States to Belgrade. The ashes are displayed in a
gold-plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the Nikola Tesla
Museum.[277] Nikola Tesla's Archive consists of over 160,000
original documents and is included in UNESCO Memory of the
World Programme.[278][279]

Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his
inventions.[280] Some of Tesla's patents are not accounted for, and
various sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in
patent archives. There are a minimum of 278 known patents[280] issued to Tesla in 26 countries. Many of
Tesla's patents were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but many other patents were approved in
countries around the globe.[281] Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.

Notes
Footnotes
a. Tesla does not mention which professor this was by name, but some sources conclude this
was Martin Sekulić.[23][24]
b. Tesla's contemporaries remembered that on a previous occasion Machine Works manager
Batchelor had been unwilling to give Tesla a $7 a week pay raise[55]
c. Account comes from a letter Tesla sent in 1938 on the occasion of receiving an award from
the National Institute of Immigrant Welfare[63]
d. Tesla's own experiments led him to erroneously believe Hertz had misidentified a form of
conduction instead of a new form of electromagnetic radiation, an incorrect assumption that
Tesla held for a couple of decades.[140][141]
